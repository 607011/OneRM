The 1RM is useful to determine an individual's maximum strength. It's also useful to determine the correct weights (as % of 1RM) when training for a specific goal. 

_One-RM_ by default uses the [Brzycki formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum#Brzycki) to calculate the 1RM from a given weight lifted for a certain number of repetitions. You can choose any combination of the formulas of Brzycki, Epley, McGlothin, Mayhew et al., O'Conner et al. and Wathen.
