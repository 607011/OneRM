![Main screen](1rm-main.png) ![Percentages screen](percentages.png)

This app currently uses only the [Brzycki formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum#Brzycki) to calculate the 1RM from a given weight lifted for a certain number of repetitions.

The 1RM is useful to determine an individual's maximum strength. It's also useful to determine the correct weights (as % of 1RM) when training for a specific goal.
